One of the most popular ways to isolate context is to split it across sub-agents. A motivation for the OpenAI [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm?ref=blog.langchain.com) library was [separation of concerns](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/ref/agent/?ref=blog.langchain.com), where a team of agents can handle specific sub-tasks. Each agent has a specific set of tools, instructions, and its own context window.

Split context across multiple agents

Anthropic’s [multi-agent researcher](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system?ref=blog.langchain.com) makes a case for this: many agents with isolated contexts outperformed single-agent, largely because each subagent context window can be allocated to a more narrow sub-task. As the blog said:

> _[Subagents operate] in parallel with their own context windows, exploring different aspects of the question simultaneously._

Of course, the challenges with multi-agent include token use (e.g., up to [15× more tokens](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system?ref=blog.langchain.com) than chat as reported by Anthropic), the need for careful [prompt engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system?ref=blog.langchain.com) to plan sub-agent work, and coordination of sub-agents.

**Context Isolation with Environments**

HuggingFace’s [deep researcher](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research?ref=blog.langchain.com#:~:text=From%20building%20,it%20can%20still%20use%20it) shows another interesting example of context isolation. Most agents use [tool calling APIs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview?ref=blog.langchain.com), which return JSON objects (tool arguments) that can be passed to tools (e.g., a search API) to get tool feedback (e.g., search results). HuggingFace uses a [CodeAgent](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030?ref=blog.langchain.com), which outputs that contains the desired tool calls. The code then runs in a [sandbox](https://e2b.dev/?ref=blog.langchain.com). Selected context (e.g., return values) from the tool calls is then passed back to the LLM.

Sandboxes can isolate context from the LLM.

This allows context to be isolated from the LLM in the environment. Hugging Face noted that this is a great way to isolate token-heavy objects in particular:

No problem, just assign it as a variable_[_in your state and you [use it later]_](https://deepwiki.com/search/i-am-wondering-if-state-that-i_0e153539-282a-437c-b2b0-d2d68e51b873?ref=blog.langchain.com)_._
