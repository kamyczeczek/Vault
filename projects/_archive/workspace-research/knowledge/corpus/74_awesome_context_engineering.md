That's why we treat the file system as the ultimate context in Manus: unlimited in size, persistent by nature, and directly operable by the agent itself. The model learns to write to and read from files on demand—using the file system not just as storage, but as structured, externalized memory.

Our compression strategies are always designed to be restorable. For instance, the content of a web page can be dropped from the context as long as the URL is preserved, and a document's contents can be omitted if its path remains available in the sandbox. This allows Manus to shrink context length without permanently losing information.

While developing this feature, I found myself imagining what it would take for a State Space Model (SSM) to work effectively in an agentic setting. Unlike Transformers, SSMs lack full attention and struggle with long-range backward dependencies. But if they could master file-based memory—externalizing long-term state instead of holding it in context—then their speed and efficiency might unlock a new class of agents. Agentic SSMs could be the real successors to [Neural Turing Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401).

### Manipulate Attention Through Recitation

If you've worked with Manus, you've probably noticed something curious: when handling complex tasks, it tends to create a todo.md file—and update it step-by-step as the task progresses, checking off completed items.

That's not just cute behavior—it's a deliberate mechanism to manipulate attention.

A typical task in Manus requires around 50 tool calls on average. That's a long loop—and since Manus relies on LLMs for decision-making, it's vulnerable to drifting off-topic or forgetting earlier goals, especially in long contexts or complicated tasks.

By constantly rewriting the todo list, Manus is reciting its objectives into the end of the context. This pushes the global plan into the model's recent attention span, avoiding "lost-in-the-middle" issues and reducing goal misalignment. In effect, it's using natural language to bias its own focus toward the task objective—without needing special architectural changes.

### Keep the Wrong Stuff In

Agents make mistakes. That's not a bug—it's reality. Language models hallucinate, environments return errors, external tools misbehave, and unexpected edge cases show up all the time. In multi-step tasks, failure is not the exception; it's part of the loop.
