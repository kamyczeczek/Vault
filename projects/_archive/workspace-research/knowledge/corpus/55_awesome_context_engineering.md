The mechanism for selecting context from a scratchpad depends upon how the scratchpad is implemented. If it’s a [tool](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool?ref=blog.langchain.com), then an agent can simply read it by making a tool call. If it’s part of the agent’s runtime state, then the developer can choose what parts of state to expose to an agent each step. This provides a fine-grained level of control for exposing scratchpad context to the LLM at later turns.

**Memories**

If agents have the ability to save memories, they also need the ability to select memories relevant to the task they are performing. This can be useful for a few reasons. Agents might select few-shot examples ([episodic](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#memory-types)[memories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427?ref=blog.langchain.com)) for examples of desired behavior, instructions ([procedural](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#memory-types)[memories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427?ref=blog.langchain.com)) to steer behavior, or facts ([semantic](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#memory-types)[memories](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02427?ref=blog.langchain.com)) for task-relevant context.

One challenge is ensuring that relevant memories are selected. Some popular agents simply use a narrow set of files that are _always_ pulled into context. For example, many code agent use specific files to save instructions (”procedural” memories) or, in some cases, examples (”episodic” memories). Claude Code uses [`CLAUDE.md`](http://claude.md/?ref=blog.langchain.com). [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules?ref=blog.langchain.com) and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor/directory?ref=blog.langchain.com) use rules files.

But, if an agent is storing a larger [collection](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#collection) of facts and / or relationships (e.g., [semantic](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/?ref=blog.langchain.com#memory-types) memories), selection is harder. [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8590148-memory-faq?ref=blog.langchain.com) is a good example of a popular product that stores and selects from a large collection of user-specific memories.
