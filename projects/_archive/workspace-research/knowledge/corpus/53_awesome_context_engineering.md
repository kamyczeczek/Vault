However, long-running tasks and accumulating feedback from tool calls mean that agents often utilize a large number of tokens. This can cause numerous problems: it can [exceed the size of the context window](https://cognition.ai/blog/kevin-32b?ref=blog.langchain.com), balloon cost / latency, or degrade agent performance. Drew Breunig [nicely outlined](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html?ref=blog.langchain.com) a number of specific ways that longer context can cause perform problems, including:

*   [Context Poisoning: When a hallucination makes it into the context](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html?ref=blog.langchain.com#context-poisoning)
*   [Context Distraction: When the context overwhelms the training](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html?ref=blog.langchain.com#context-distraction)
*   [Context Confusion: When superfluous context influences the response](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html?ref=blog.langchain.com#context-confusion)
*   [Context Clash: When parts of the context disagree](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html?ref=blog.langchain.com#context-clash)

Context from tool calls accumulates over multiple agent turns

With this in mind, [Cognition](https://cognition.ai/blog/dont-build-multi-agents?ref=blog.langchain.com) called out the importance of context engineering:

> _“Context engineering” … is effectively the #1 job of engineers building AI agents._

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system?ref=blog.langchain.com) also laid it out clearly:

> _Agents often engage in conversations spanning hundreds of turns, requiring careful context management strategies._

So, how are people tackling this challenge today? We group common strategies for agent context engineering into four buckets — **write, select, compress, and isolate —** and give examples of each from review of some popular agent products and papers. We then explain how LangGraph is designed to support them!

General categories of context engineering

### Write Context

_Writing context means saving it outside the context window to help an agent perform a task._
