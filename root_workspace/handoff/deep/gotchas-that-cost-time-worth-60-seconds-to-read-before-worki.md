# Gotchas that cost time (worth 60 seconds to read before working)

- **Polyrepo — verify before concluding anything about tree state.** Run
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in whatever directory you are in. Root and
  each `projects/research/*` are independent repos.
- **Handoff was not a state machine (fixed 2026-10-03).** `.claude/session-handoff.md` in
  `agentic-research-lab` and the old root `HANDOFF.md` were both hand-written, with no
  script rebuilding either — the root one is now derived (`handoff/flags/<flag>.md` +
  `handoff/deep/` -> `scripts/build_handoff.py` -> `HANDOFF.md`, `--check` gates
  staleness; flag file `handoff_flag_per_file_icm`). The ARL project handoff is still
  hand-written. The project handoff had gone stale for two sessions before 2026-10-01,
  and a 2026-10-02 audit of this file found six stale claims at once (a module
  count, two HEAD pointers, the gate check list, a "no run has ever existed"
  line contradicted by a closed run on disk, and an open-vs-done follow-up).
  Audit both by grepping for claims — `findstr /n /c:"<number>" /c:"<sha>"` —
  not by reading one file and assuming the other agrees. A fix found by grep
  must be applied to every file grep can reach.
- **`reflection/loop_state.json` is not a ralph loop.** In
  `agentic-research-lab` it is a list of SHA-256 hashes, read only by
  `pipeline/06_reflect/spawn.py:48`, which uses `MAX_IDENTICAL_EVENTS = 3` to
  damp repeated reflection events. It is untracked since `5fd1d26` and still on
  disk. The `ralph-loop` skill is vendored (`819427c`); the one run that exists
  is closed — see `ralph_run_closed` above.
- **`$?` after a pipe reports the pipe, not Python.** `python gate.py | tail -3;
  echo $?` always prints 0. Capture the exit code before piping, or redirect to
  a file and read it after. `scripts/_scratch/run_and_rc.sh` does this for you.
- **G12 follow-ups are closed in project `## Open work`, not open.** The
  pi_models.py un-ignore (`82b078a`) and the no-artifact-on-failure defect
  (`024f9a5`) are both marked DONE 2026-10-01 in
  `projects/research/agentic-research-lab/CONTEXT.md` `## Open work`, so a
  `CLAUDE.md` → `CONTEXT.md` session sees them as finished.
- **ARL root resolution was one level short after the group move (fixed
  2026-10-02, `1d20066`; scar #7 in ARL `EXPERIENCE.md`).** The failure mode
  is generic: any "look up to the workspace root" path computed from a fixed
  number of `..` hops (`parents[N]`, hard-coded `../..`) silently breaks on
  any reorg — probe `scripts/*.py` for `parents[` after a move. The nested-
  `agentic-research-lab/` dir (a CRLF copy of part of the repo, 3,766 files,
  plus 121 worktree-deleted originals) and the `$null` root debris are the
  same day's tree-shape incidents: run `git status` early, verify a copy is
  byte-identical before deleting anything.

- **`close_session.py` runs `audit_workspace.py` only**, not the 21-gate
  workspace suite. The full suite is what pre-commit runs.
- **ARL `preflight.py` exits 1 on two failed reflection runs** (`bg-smoke3`,
  `smoke-scratch-02`) whose artifacts still fail the gate. That is a standing
  hard block, unrelated to any current work: the 21-gate chain itself is 21/21
  green, and `agent_commit.py` commits fine past it. Run
  `python scripts/quality_check.py` directly when preflight blocks you.
