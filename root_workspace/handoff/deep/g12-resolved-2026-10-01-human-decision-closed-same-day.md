# G12 — resolved 2026-10-01 (human decision), closed same day

`reflect.py` is the canonical reflection runner. Speed was the decider: 52 s
single structured call vs `spawn.py`'s 275 s; G11 quality passed for both,
so the wall-clock gap carried no quality signal. Recorded with ABANDON lines
(protocol: recorded, not deleted) in
`projects/research/agentic-research-lab/GATES-T1-phase04-runner.md`.

Follow-ups (both done 2026-10-01):
1. `scripts/pi_models.py` was un-ignored (`.gitignore` entry removed) and
   entered through `agent_commit.py` — commit `82b078a`. Never `git add .`.
2. The carried defect — failed runs wrote no artifact, so a failed run was
   indistinguishable from a never-run one — is fixed in
   `pipeline/06_reflect/reflect.py`: `agent_trace` ledger records
   (`run`/`failure` events with `failure_kind`: `bad_json`, `missing_key`,
   `unexpected_response`, or exception class), plus endpoint resolution moved
   in-run so a missing pi config is a traced failed run, not an import crash.
   Pinned by 4 new tests (`024f9a5`).
